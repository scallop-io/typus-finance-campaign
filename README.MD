## Typus Finance Giveaway WL Campaign Randomization Process

### Event Rule

- A snapshot will be taken at the end of the event.
- User with vesca >= 800.

### Randomization Logic

After taking a snapshot at a random time and compiling a list of eligible users, we will select 100 random users to receive the Whitelist for Typus Finance TGE. Here is the process for selecting random users:

1. Retrieve the complete list of eligible users.
2. Select a future drand round to use as the seed for hashing the list.
3. When the chosen drand round occurs, use that round's Drand result as the source of randomness.
4. Combine each user's Sui address with the randomness in the format {address}{randomness}, and then hash this combination using the Blake2b algorithm, producing a hash result in hexadecimal form.
5. Convert the hexadecimal hash result into a number.
6. Sort these numbers from largest to smallest and pick the top 100 users from the sorted results as winners of the Typus Finance Giveaway WL.
